it means gossip scuttlebutt in slang usage means rumor or gossip deriving from the nautical term for the cask used to serve water or later a water fountain the term corresponds to the colloquial concept of a water cooler in an office setting which at times becomes the focus of congregation and casual discussion,-0.1531
i read in an article in guitar player i believe that srv used to superglue his fretting fingertips to his other arm and then pull them free with skin patches attached because his fingertips were shreaded from playing so hard on the heavy 0 13 set of strings trying to play those bends every night when touring would only have contributed to that problem,0.4467
nice approach and tutorial thanks for sharing the magic btw what amp are you using in this video,0.8176

30 years ago i could manage 2nd fret bends on 11s like that but i am 60 now and my fingers and callouses have gone soft plus i am straight mostly these days a super reverb cranked helps make the guitar play itself as well and i sold my beloved 14 years ago still cryin,0.9721

ok so i m a bit confused about one thing the last note of challenge 2 is to either bend the b string 3rd fret or slide it up to the 5th fret or e note david says to use an upstroke then the first note of challenge 3 is the little e string open david says it s important to use an upstroke for it too so does this mean we are supposed to use 2 upstrokes in a row first on the b string bend slide then again on the little e string at the start of challenge 3,0.323
you need to tackle that when doves cry intro someday better get ready,0.3182
if srv learned to play and sound exactly like say muddy watters we would not have srv i think the thing is to play it as it sounds best to you that how they used to learn listen to it on a record play it yeah that good enough for the bar downtown anyway love your videos keep up the good content,0.9753
thank you been wanting to learn this song for years brilliant and flawless recreation,0.8625
older even than the great state o texas scut tle butt ˈskədlˌbət learn to pronounce nouninformal north american noun scuttlebutt rumor gossip the scuttlebutt has it that he was a spy origin early 19th century denoting a water butt on the deck of a ship providing drinking water from scuttled butt sailors would traditionally exchange gossip when they gathered at the scuttlebutt for a drink of water,0.4019
6 40 he actually plays 2 3 2 instead of just 3 2 there and this is almost impossible so was so damn fast this part sounds light a lightning striking another lightning,-0.4255

love the vid u should do more stevie ray vaughan videos,0.6369

great lesson thank you something i never even bothered to try learning because it sounds so fast that it s intimidating learnt it in about half an hour with your great video in answer to your video title hardest blues riff i have to say i think srv s testify solo sections or rude mood are harder a video on those would be great if there isn t already,0.8971

bravo davids,0.0
so much of srv s sound comes from his strength if you want to get into that style then you need to start basically beating the shit out of your guitar but with precision this is a really great video btw paul i ve been following you since about 30k subs and it s been a real joy watching your channel grow,0.9436

nice vid but the ads that do not allow you to skip ahead totally suck shit and ruin it,-0.951
great video this is my favourite topic of yours i m not sure if you would find the following worthy of a video the lick at 2mins 10secs of ac dc s back in black i have slowed it down in ableton and still cannot nail it i think it s the speed at which angus does his vibrato that makes it tricky but i m still not sure i would be interested in your thoughts i haven t come across any youtuber you plays it correctly to my ears,0.745
why is your nut lower than the top of your fret board,-0.1027

love that little satire you did on the typical youtuber intro,0.6369
hi paul in reference to your explanation of why is the intro riff to baby you can drive my car so confusing it starts on the 4th off beat maybe you should have made it clear that this one also does not start on the 1 but rather on the second 16th of the 3rd beat or does it you tell me that might have been your challenge number 1 p,0.2393
i was getting ready to say thats not how he plays it on the record tho well done for getting it right,0.4329
i would be keen to see a video on how good of a player is john mayer really,0.6597
oooo yeah this is the one thnx paul for the vid an some great insights struggling with this one for sure two things iv noticed bout the lick is when he plays it for the first time without bass drums it sounds clear and everything is to say by the book as you explained but when the band kicks in i think there is something more going on to this lick that makes it well hard to play i think its the rhythm or something the way he plays it which par he accents i dont know the feel of it especialy live thers something in that first bend slide seams kind of dragged and then he shoots trough the lick but kind of pauses at some parts i dont know its hard to explain the other thing is that e that he hits on the bass string at the end he does it with the upstroke live i play the ending part same as you with pulloffs or slideoff on the g and cant end on upstroke same as you its awkward i think he picks something more there or something i dont know maybe im wrong definetly the simple but somehow hardest riff guys gals what do you think,0.7622

so meta it hurt my future self mind remembering it later today,-0.5667

niiiice but i think this is still not as difficult as rude mood especially for picking speed,-0.3259
did you drink the grolsch for that strap lock,0.0
i think your pull off from the 3rd fret g string to 2nd fret g string is actually meant to be a quick slide from 2nd to 3rd back to 2nd so on a tab it would be 2 3 2p0 all with the middle finger opinions if you look at videos of srv doing it you can see what i mean and it actually has quite an audible difference would love to hear what other people think to me it doesn t sound quite right with just a simple pull off like paul does nonetheless great video love it edit just watched the live vid that paul is showing and srv is definitely doing it like i ve said above most of the time but sometimes in the transition from b7 back to e referencing standard tuning he is doing a simpler version that looks more like pauls interesting,0.9538
i usually bend it myself the studio version always sounded bended to me,0.0

thank you thank you thank you never thought this was within reach of my capabilities with a little alot practice it just might be,0.765
there is one more bend slide on the downward pentatonic run a quick sneaky 1 2 step bend on the ab you can tell because in the video you cite where he compensates with slides he does 3 slides as opposed to the 2 slides bends you mention so the 1st and 3rd bends start from the same note but do not bother whole stepping the 3rd cool video,0.6192
dude you killed it on this video kudos,-0.296
the lick at the turnaround is not the same as the others it the lick used for the turnaround in mary had a little lamb awesome videos,0.5888
really like the editing on the vids a very captain disillusion feel,0.1317
just one more thing to add to it is that srv used to play with absurdly high gauges strings try to play that with 13 set of strings just thinking about it already hurt my finger tips haha,0.5267
two master strat ist gone by plane crash buddy holly srv,-0.4019
now do it on 13s with bends if you bleed you lose i read that he has played as fat as 17s at one point he had everyone thinking you needed ridiculously fat strings for great tone but that has long be debunked in a b tests,0.1779
he taught me about super glue and cuts on that hand,0.7096
i was playing it even harder ha it funny how we over complicate things for ourselves sometimes good effort good analysis next is eddie van halen jump solo some say each line is layered maybe so playable though with some short cuts just a thought appreciate your efforts,0.9081

good job you can hear a lot of elements of stevie technique in that slow down and where they come from classic blues records you can take those bends and voicings and apply them in his version voodoo chile and many others the record deep bends at the nut end of the neck are that deep old school blues sound srv just nailed it at supersonic speed without losing the original feel of them i grew up watching stevie and his brother in texas way back when scuttlebutt is a nautical term for gossip it is literally water cooler talk derived from the name of a water jug,0.3447

hey paul i have always done a hammer on pull off on the g string during the descending part on the 2nd and 3rd frets are you not hearing that in the song either way the timing feels more exact to me when i play along with the song at half speed full speed is just a blur so who can tell lol,0.6369
thank you guitar pewdiepie srv is my favorite guitarist,0.6705

great playing and teaching especially noting the various approaches to playing the song bends v slides etc,0.7717
scuttle buttin is basically like saying hurry your a up scuttle you re butt over here would be like get your butt over hear in a hurry for a song with no lyrics the name is extremely appropriate because the whole song form the rhythm to the tempo portrays a feeling of rushing through something for me it invokes visions of trucker in the us hauling ass to get to his drop off point on time to get his next load or a bunch of crazy karen s rushing through a mall on black friday trying to get the best deals on everything whilst yelling for managers left and right,0.34
srv was the best ever you make it look so easy when you break it down like this unfortunately my arthritic fingers can not do that anymore thanks for these amazing videos,0.937
that was his style of playing what is the point of understanding srv in slow motion imo,0.2023
i believe scuttlebuttin would be the extra slang turning scuttlebutt into a verb it basically means gossiping if one were to ask what is the scuttlebutt it means what is the latest news gossip talk,-0.5106

awesome video that made me understand better why i have been struggling so much with this riff for so many years it sounds simple but it is definitely not an easy one to nail down srv what a player he had it all we sorely miss him incidentally the difficulties associated with scuttlebuttin somewhat remind me about another apparently simple riff frusciante riff for snow,-0.1677

as others mentioned scuttlebutting is gossiping and more commonly used in the military,-0.3818
a scuttlebutt is a naval term that refers to a water fountain in the days of olde the buckets which held drinking water sailors would often congregate around the scuttlebutt and pass gossip the act of gossiping became known as scuttlebutting here in texas amongst other places we have a tendency to drop the g from the ing ending of words thus scuttlebuttin was a word for gossiping or just talkin bout whatever comes to mind meanderin from subject to subject stevie use of the word here is referencing the idea that this was just a quick little improvisation riff with no real intent to flesh out to something more substantial just a riff a glorious riff i tell you what,-0.4417

this should be the end all youtube video for the scuttle buttin lick fully analyzed and great job to learn to olay it properly subgroup the notes and practice practice practice also it is important to mention that srv played the individual notes of his live slide version using only his middle finger,0.8207

i remember the first time i heard this track i was about 15 years old i was in bed falling asleep listening to the album the essential stevie ray vaughan and double trouble i was in that weird part where you are kind of half way between awake and asleep when this started playing and i had no idea what was going on when i woke up the next day i thought it was a dream or half conscious hallucination because of how nuts it sounded turned out to be a real track,-0.6908

srv legend an amazingly simple tune but add srvs magic sauce and it becomes something amazing well played paul ps scuttle buttin is a slang term for gossip based on a nautical term its an old version of water cooler chat,0.872
wow i spent hours days and weeks a ten or fifteen years ago getting this down and forgot how much fun it is to play once you get the muscle memory going and just let it rip one thing that helped me then was using two fingers to make the bends like the second and third fingers,0.9001
dude great video stevie actually used hybrid picking i never knew this until recently and after i realized it it so noticeable that plucked e sticks out so much plus you can see live that he plucks it just once though on the first high e thanks dude your videos are great,0.9022
wow i always thought the main riff was a slide cause i have seen him do so in live videos see below i wonder if he did it differently live because of the strain on the fingers especially with him switching to thinner string gauges later in his career https youtu be v0l4kpdmfnc,0.5574

an engineer and his wife who i know for a fact worked quite a few srv shows pre and post sobriety told me stevie and the boys would walk on for sound check plug in and just rip right in to this song effortlessly they say all the time that the vaughn brothers and the rest of the crew were not only some of the best musicians they ever worked with but also super humble and respectful even in the early days when they were raising hell in his words,0.6757

srv to me is undoublty a guitar god i personally am not a big fan of blues but put some srv or some hendrix he bluesy come on or clapton and i will enjoy it srv had soul to his playing and definitely defined the genre he sits right up there with b b king personally the blues is good but there a time and a mood for it i will occasionally noodle some pride and joy but its not what i focus on one of srv solos that i do enjoy is the sky is crying at least i think that the name or close to it and it all to do with the emotion and feel you put into it take a modern day guitarist like john mayer i love john mayer music because he diverse rock blues jazz neon has jazzy elements and he shows soul in hid playing there are players today who still show soul i sense a new wave of blues and rock coming for my generation when you think about it all these modern day guitar god that are still living are still kicking and still giving 100 effort recently i have been wanting to start to listen to some of john petrucci music after listening glasgow kiss yes i have listened to it but not the whole thing until this weekend jp has been producing music with dream theater since the 90s dt fans dont hate me i do not listen to them and other virtuoso like my idol steve vai has a lot of soul in his music in this realm of modern day guitar god satriani vai abasi govan petrucci mayer and etc they have studied their craft to a tee and are able to have skill and play fast yet show soul take steve vai whispering a prayer that has soul in it its conveying emotion about talking to a god in a whisper asking for protection or forgiveness or help i base all of my musical emotions from the great victor wooten he said in his book the music lesson that music is not a school of thought but more like a person he says that we are all born with a natural rhythm we just need someone to give us the key to open the door and meet music herself you have to nurture and care for her music or else your relationship with it will weaken and become bland that my view on this,0.9982
thanks once again for a great tutorial paul i eventually nailed it,0.7906
i am feeling so proud because i learned this song in my second of guitar,0.6696
i am not trying to start any controversy here honestly but the only remarkable thing about this song to me is that it played incredibly fast musically speaking it sounds like a pretty cliched set of blues riffs and chords of course being able to play something totally clean and at a really high tempo is a bona fide skill but for me at least that not enough on its own to make it musically all that interesting to listen to for very long so technically amazing musically somewhat boring i have the same issue with bluegrass music a lot of the time with some exceptions for instance earl scruggs tony rice sam bush bela fleck or in classical music with someone like paganini whose pieces can be extremely challenging to play but not all that interesting to listen to playing an instrument really fast and really well can just seem like a cool dog and pony trick if the composition is in itself mundane okay cue the abuse i guess i asked for it,0.994
srv yeee boii,0.0
this is by far the best tutorial video for this song i have been looking at other tutorial videos for this song for like about a month now and all of the teachers were teaching this song in lightening speed like us beginners are going to pick it up easily thank you for putting out this awesome video my friend,0.9689
you would sound more like him if you started the first bend a little bit later as it is it does not sound the same to me,0.4201
check out texas blues by gary moore the intro is not as tricky but it took me a few times to learn it by ear i learn everthing by ear and can now work out songs without a guitar in my hand,0.6728
amazing vedio and the best lesson of scuttle buttin quick question is this the neck pick up i can not really tell,0.8402

i have never seen anyone play this riff as well as stevie ray did i have seen 1 person get really close but everyone else plays it like they just learned the riff 10 minutes ago i will update this comment once i hear you play it update your notes were great but you missed the finesse that srv had it sounds like your timing between certain notes was off but i am not sure great video though it taught me a bit,0.953
thank for breaking down this magic riff paul for anyone who struggles with this riff skip all the bends and just do slides that is how stevie does it live and many other players also some people hybrid pick that riff by using middle finger first time you hit the open e personally i prefer to pick it all but i am sure using hybrid picking would work just as fine,0.631
your voice is very soothing love it,0.7947

haven t even watched it yet and this is already my favorite paul davids video always know when paul uploads it ll be great,0.7964
play some basic penta stuff super fast and people will scream genius then same people will say shredders only play fast and have no feel,0.5859
doing a whole note bend on frets that low and on the higher tenser strings is not easy esp when you do them that fast srv was a different breed to do them on 13 gage strings,-0.7189
bending the second fret g is just tiring to the hand no matter the gaugem,0.2732

it unbelievable how much attention to detail you put into playing everything right most guitarist would just download the tabs and play it about 80 right but the attention to detail will skyrocket you into a so much better sound really great,0.9307
srv couldnt stand the weather is the record that changed my life i played it non stop i picked up a guitar have not put it down since r i p s r v,0.0516
aw man i wish i had your videos in 1994 when i was trying to learn this on my own and failed miserably of course,-0.5719
just wanted to say paul your consistently great video editing and creative ways of teaching guitar does not go unnoticed thank you for putting so much thought and creativity into it your tutorials,0.8171
thank you so much for sharing this would like to learn more srv songs and other blues ideas in general love your teaching and video thanks again,0.9345
bomp excelente video how about rude mood,-0.4588
he did change his methods for which he played this riff and many others srv also played light gauge strings toward the last parts of his life due to the pain in his hands much love,0.6908
i feel like i should start learning this now mainly because i just realized i am wearing the exact same shirt as paul picks up guitar,0.3612

everyday of my adult life i pray for the strength to play like srv for just 1min,0.8555
well done sir,0.2732
much love for your editing in this video best regards,0.8555
what a great video thank you paul,0.765
its such a coincidence cause just the other day i became aware of the song and began practising it the universe i guess haha,0.4588
during the video i got 3 damn ads for that mouthbreathing neckbeard aussie guitar lesson guy,-0.4019
haha that my dads ringtone,0.4588
and that s why stevie was still is the greatest,0.6369
it means gossiping more or less naval term for sitting around talking,-0.3818
great research paul,0.6249
for a cool piece of trivia i saw stevie in an interview where he said he came up with this song by trying to learn lonnie mack song chickin pickin but could not figure out what lonnie was doing and ended up with this song as a result maybe lonnie song would be a good follow up to teach after this one because you can play anything paul,0.8225
gosh that made my day big hugs thx,0.6908
another great video paul thank you,0.765
his soundcheck video is also savage the first song he plays on the stage no warm up is scuttlebuttin,-0.3182
i been watching your video since 2 5 years but never got bored you upload pretty nice content paul,0.8812
those bends at 13 gauge strings blood lot of blood i always wondered about this riff and now i know this confirmed my inability to play it though will i ever,-0.0772
you should have released this great video on the 27th the 30th anniversary of his death,0.2441
this was an amazing video i love the fact that you include the way to study it and alternative picking and alternative ways to actually play it thank you very much please do include these things in future videos much love from argentina,0.9622
srv makes me proud to be from texas and little else,0.4767
i was literally just playing this riff and now you upload a video of it awesome i usually play a slide on the g string on the last run like 2 3 2 0 in my opinion it gives it a bit more bite,0.8689
absolutely mental,0.0
its not hard i played it on my kazoo,-0.1877
no way i was listening to vaughan music and thought i should learn one of his easier songs and paul just uploads this vid so good,0.6532
i have recently read in an interview with his guitar tech that srv did not actually use that high a gauge of strings aparently his low e and high e were fatter 0 013set for the emphasis especially how important that low e string is in blues music but the strings in between were actually alot thinner probably a 0 009 or even 0 008 set it still makes sense he would do slides live to get less strain on his wrists and fingers he did long sets and played live alot even with thinner strings that would still be alot of tension i assume,-0.0699
in 9 30 when you said but still it sounded a little bit in my head i said pitchy i can see that roomyofficiel effect lol,0.5719

i remember when one of my buddies was learning this he got so mad he slung a tuner against the wall lol i love to play it and i do use the bends i actually think rude mood is his hardest riff it just pride and joy on roids but to play it clean is insanely hard,0.8687

wow cool video what equipment are you using i am curious because you nailed both the playing style and the tone,0.8481
in the descending part of the riff i use 2nd finger to slide from the a to a then pull off for the g seems to sound more correct to me the thing i find astonishing about this srv recording or any of them probably is that when you slow them to half or 3 4 speed the shape of his bends and slides the evenness clarity and accuracy of every single note are all perfect the speed of his playing is not hiding any sloppiness at all,0.8437
slides bend fast bends fast slides pfttt david at the tempo srv plays this riff no one can hear the difference anyway correction no non guitar player listener but hey play it with a bend as srv did the original 1 take recording go crazy with it all i really care,0.7899

best lesson on this on youtube ever thanks paul love your channel how about a vid on eric gales he uses some amazing chord combinations cheers,0.9595
bending not sliding is how i was taught to play scuttle buttin over 20 years ago glad to see my teacher was on the money,0.6597
i have used slides sacrificing a little bit of precision for feasibility so to speak due to a simple reason i am human stevie was not srv was a mix of sheer force and finesse i can not go more that five bends in that area without having a tendon snapping thanks for a great video again paul,0.7906
ayyy finally srv my favourite guitarist thanks paul for this video,0.4404
been learning this for years only thing that i think you ve missed is the timing of the very first lick the first thing you hear in the record always throws me me just be the tempo but what beat does the lick start on,-0.1531
ayy u r using the same laptop as mine at least there is something we have in common,0.0
great vid love the banter as well maybe some zz top next,0.9042
one of the amazing pieces of the srv arsenal that blew my mind many years ago there has never been anyone close to him always wanted to have a go at this riff fantastic video,0.8126
nice advert attack of youtube 10min clip with 6 chromebook ads your nice clip even typing this just before the end an ad for harmony pro and vodaphone aaaahhhhggg as i said your nice clip your hard work is ruined by this much advertisement no youtube i refuse to pay for your ervices with money i already pay with my presence and companies pay for my attention ad the beginning of the clip that was made by paul with his hard work and paid with sweat attention and maybe even money to have premium upload and other youtube tools i do not understand as simple viewer and fan of paul youtube wants my attention my screen time money from creators money from companies for advertisement and now even my money to reduce the ads from the companies i refuse but paul sorry but this means i will probably also watch less of your fabulous clips because of this not your fault but youtube really ruins the experience of watching clips nowadays maybe youtube is scuttle buttin your clip also not knowing what it really is but has a nice ring to it,0.6544
awesome and humbling as always,0.6249

scuttlebutt is gossip so i guess scuttlebuttin means gossiping this comes from an old navy term for a water barrel and i guess its just the same has how people gossip around a water cooler i can kinda see stevie chillin at the water barrel smoking his pipe hth did he do those whole tone bends at the second fret with 13 gauge strings,-0.6124
thank you very much for the correct way to play this very difficult to discern what he s doing unless one can slow it down,0.2748
nice thanks for the lesson,0.6908
variation 163 on the chuck berry lick thanks for rock n roll guitar chuck rock on people say he stole it from whoever but wth what is great about this the chuck berry lick that sounds like srv really cool,0.8638
try doing all that whilst smoking on a pipe srv was one hell of a guitarist,-0.6808
i never really cared anything about steve but i do know one day i randomly figured out how to play this on accident i didn t even know it was a srv song,-0.4261
srv is essentially a god at rhythm guitar pride and joy i think very captivates that scuttle butting is also such a guitar driven song it what made me fall in love with his guitar work,0.91
thanks paul that was the best srv tutorial i ve seen i remember buying a tab book back in the 90 s and shelving it after about a week of frustration,0.6124
scuttlebutt in slang usage means rumor or gossip deriving from the nautical term for the cask used to serve water or later a water fountain the term corresponds to the colloquial concept of a water cooler in an office setting which at times becomes the focus of congregation and casual discussion,0.0258
srv never played the same twice that for sure,0.068
in my humble opinion it would be great if you take a closer look to gary moore and his tastefull style of bending,0.6249

when working on this challenging riff i take a break by watching the srv soundcheck vid big yawns goofing around dialing in tones and then straight in to scuttle buttin for the freaking sound check def inspires me to keep pushing for the fluidity and ease of this cramped and blisteringly hard riff i am playing on les paul scale length with 10 can not imaging 13 on strat length legendary,0.6858

sorry guy until you get a felt fedora and smoking pipe you ll never nail that riff or tone the right way,-0.0772
i do not know why but a strat sounds better tuned down to e flat,0.5927
aha 1 is spot on i learned to play the bend from a guitar player tab way back in the early 90s and it always sounded and felt right then around 20 years later a guy who had learned it from yt said no it played with a slide i was what no way he was so adamant i started to second guess myself glad you finally put that to rest,0.5267
